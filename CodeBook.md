Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project - CodeBook
=================================================
This file describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I have performed to clean up the data.

* The site where the data was obtained:

* The data for the project:

* The run_analysis.R script performs the following steps to clean the data:
    1. Read X_train.txt, y_train.txt and subject_train.txt from the "./train" folder and store them in trainX, trainY and trainSubject variables respectively.
